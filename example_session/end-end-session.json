Instead, we should seek to explore its potential to “shift power” in the direction of learners, who in our context are learners of languages and applied linguistics. The event will be highly relevant for researchers, educators, learners and other languages and applied linguistics practitioners alike. The conference will primarily be conducted in English, and all abstract submissions must be in English. However, we encourage the creative and inclusive use of multiple languages throughout the conference sessions, supported by AI tools for translation to ensure accessibility. Please note that interpretation/translation services will not be provided. All submissions will undergo a double-blind peer review process. Authors will be notified of acceptance in time to register by the registration deadline. Full Programme The conference programme can be downloaded here: Full Programme Scope and Topics This conference will explore how power is being shifted towards, away from, and between learners and educators by AI technologies, and the new dynamic and potential changes this is bringing about in applied linguistics, languages and cultures studies. Potential topics for the papers may include, but are not limited to: AI and its impact on the training and evolving roles of languages and applied linguistics educators and their relationships with learners; AI and its potential to support inclusive and personalised learning in languages and applied linguistics; AI integration into learning, teaching and assessment of languages, cultures and applied linguistics with a focus on ethical issues and sustainability challenges; Core concepts and theoretical frameworks guiding the integration of AI in applied linguistics; Core concepts and theoretical frameworks guiding the integration of AI in the learning and teaching of languages and cultures; Questions around the use of AI in carrying out research in languages, cultures and applied linguistics, and its impact on research processes and outputs. Session Formats Both in-person and virtual attendance will be available. One of the parallel strands will be completely online and open to both online and onsite attendees. The remaining parallel strands will be onsite and open to onsite attendees only. There will be one single online strand with sessions accessible to attendees both online and onsite. The online strand will include the streaming of the keynotes and the expert panel. The online strand will run in parallel with all other strands which will be onsite only (i.e. no online participation ). One presenter from teams who want to present in the online strand must be designated as the online moderator. For sessions with a single presenter, an online moderator will be provided. Onsite presentations – by teams as well as individuals – will all have a moderator. >> Facilitated Discussions (40 minutes) These in person or online sessions should propose a topic or challenge that is relevant to the wider field of AI-enhanced learning and teaching of languages and cultures and (applied) linguistics and provide two to three thought-provoking questions and/or breakout activities in order to guide an interactive conversation with attendees. Proposals can include roles for up to 3 facilitators but should focus on engaging participants rather than developing a panel of presenters. Proposals must describe the topic or challenge and explain the framework for drawing out discussion and involving in-person or online participants in active conversation. Submissions should include the aforementioned questions/discussion prompts and/or breakout activities that the author(s) would like to pose to attendees to spark conversation on the presentation topic. (Proposals for Facilitated Discussions should not exceed 300 words) >> Presentations (20 min) These in-person or online sessions should consist of a maximum of 15 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for Q&A.

This mini-review synthesizes fifteen studies published between 2020 and 2025 that collectively illustrate three dominant trends: data augmentation for imbalanced or privacy-restricted datasets, automation of expert-intensive tasks such as radiology reporting, and generation of new biomedical knowledge ranging from molecular scaffolds to fairness insights. Image-centric work still dominates, with GANs, diffusion models, and Vision-Language Models expanding limited datasets and accelerating diagnosis. Yet narrative (EHR) and molecular design domains are rapidly catching up. Despite demonstrated accuracy gains, recurring challenges persist: synthetic samples may overlook rare pathologies, large multimodal systems can hallucinate clinical facts, and demographic biases can be amplified. Robust validation, interpretability techniques, and governance frameworks therefore, remain essential before G-AI can be safely embedded in routine care. Introduction Healthcare has long grappled with the twin problems of data scarcity and data privacy. Curating large, balanced, and publicly shareable clinical datasets is expensive, logistically complex, and ethically sensitive. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (G-AI)—notably Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders, diffusion models, and large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)—offer a potential remedy by synthesising realistic yet privacy-preserving data. Table 1 collates fifteen representative studies that demonstrate how these models are already reshaping diverse clinical tasks. Table 1 Table 1. Summary of clinical generative AI applications. Medical imaging remains the most prolific test-bed for G-AI. Early work by Han et al. introduced “pathology-aware” GANs that augment computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) datasets and serve as training material for novice radiologists ( 1 ). Subsequent studies refined both fidelity and dimensionality of synthetic images. Aydin et al. re-engineered StyleGANv2 to generate three-dimensional Time-of-Flight MR angiography volumes, boosting multiclass artery segmentation without additional patient scans ( 2 ). Similar philosophies underpin Pawlicka et al.\\'s colorectal-polyp synthesis, where GAN-generated images alleviate class imbalance and improve endoscopic segmentation accuracy ( 3 ). Ultsch and Lötsch addressed melanoma detection by fine-tuning a latent Stable Diffusion model, proving that diffusion-based methods can rival GANs for dermoscopic realism ( 4 ). The promise of G-AI is not limited to raw pixels. Phipps et al. explored VLMs that translate chest x-ray features into free-text radiology reports, potentially reducing radiologist workload during high-volume shifts ( 5 ). However, their evaluation framework also revealed a tendency to hallucinate clinical findings—a stark reminder that factual grounding remains a critical bottleneck. Complementary efforts by Huang et al. in emergency-department workflows corroborate both the efficiency gains and the evaluation challenges of text-generating models ( 6 ). Beyond imaging, G-AI is venturing into molecular and systemic domains. Zeng et al. leveraged ProteinGAN and hierarchical generative models to design novel proteins and small molecules, accelerating the pre-clinical discovery pipeline ( 7 ). Bordukova et al. harnessed synthetic patient trajectories to construct digital twins that can de-risk costly clinical trials ( 8 ). At the intersection of fairness and analytics, Khosravi et al. generated radiographs that isolate race-linked imaging features, providing a sandbox for bias audits ( 9 ). These successes nonetheless surface persistent limitations. Synthetic data often fails to capture rare anatomical variants or subtle disease phenotypes, risking model over-confidence in out-of-distribution scenarios ( 4 , 10 ). Bias in training corpora can be magnified, as evidenced by demographic skew in pelvic-radiograph synthesis ( 9 ). Large multimodal systems may produce credible but incorrect statements, undermining clinical trust ( 5 , 11 ). Interpretable frameworks such as StylEx, which links StyleGAN latents to human-readable attributes, are therefore gaining traction ( 12 ). Regulatory and ethical considerations further complicate deployment. Frictionless data-sharing enabled by G-AI must still honor patient consent and institutional review protocols. Meanwhile, explainability demands are intensifying; clinicians and regulators alike now expect transparent reasoning pathways before sanctioning AI-assisted decisions. Collectively, the studies surveyed here illuminate both the transformative potential of G-AI and the rigorous safeguards required for its responsible translation to bedside practice. Methodology of literature selection To identify relevant studies, we conducted a targeted search in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus databases covering January 2020–May 2025. Keywords included “generative AI”, “synthetic data”, “clinical practice”, and “healthcare”. From over 65 initial hits, we prioritised peer-reviewed articles that explicitly applied generative AI in clinical contexts. Fifteen representative studies were chosen to illustrate diverse domains (imaging, text, molecular design, and fairness). These were not intended as an exhaustive list, but rather as exemplars highlighting the breadth and key limitations of generative AI in healthcare. Comparative analysis and discussion Table 1 distills fifteen recent studies that deploy generative AI (G-AI) across the clinical data spectrum, with medical imaging emerging as the prime test-bed. More than two-thirds of the entries apply GANs, diffusion models or Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize, augment or interpret radiographs, MRI volumes and dermoscopic, endoscopic or fundus photographs. These image-centric efforts tackle three chronic bottlenecks highlighted in Table 1 : limited data volume, class imbalance and privacy restrictions. For example, Ultsch & Lötsch fine-tune Stable Diffusion to balance melanoma classes, while Aydin et al. extend StyleGANv2 to 3-D angiography volumes, boosting vascular-segmentation accuracy without collecting new scans. Beyond imaging, Table 1 shows G-AI penetrating narrative and molecular domains. Alkhalaf et al. couple a retrieval-augmented Llama-2 with zero-shot prompting to summarise malnutrition risk factors from electronic health records, illustrating how foundation models can tame unstructured clinical text. Zeng et al. harness ProteinGAN to generate bespoke proteins, signalling a shift from data augmentation to de-novo biomedical design. Meanwhile, Pinaya and Bordukova exploit diffusion models to create synthetic chest x-rays and digital-twin trajectories respectively, lowering the cost and ethical burden of large-scale trials. The table also exposes recurring limitations. Synthetic samples often omit rare pathologies, risk distribution shifts (e.g., Pawlicka\\'s colorectal polyps) or encode demographic biases (Khosravi\\'s race-aware radiographs). VLMs hallucinate clinical facts, undermining trust in auto-generated reports. Several authors therefore call for stronger interpretability—Lang\\'s StylEx explicitly pairs StyleGAN with attribute visualisation—and for rigorous external validation before clinical rollout. Collectively, the evidence in Table 1 suggests three near-term pay-offs: (i) privacy-preserving data augmentation that accelerates model development, (ii) automation of expert-intensive tasks such as radiology reporting or phenotype annotation, and (iii) exploratory insight generation that surfaces novel biomarkers or inequities. Realising these benefits, however, hinges on closing interpretability gaps, curbing bias propagation, and establishing governance frameworks that keep pace with rapidly evolving G-AI toolchains. To mitigate these concerns, safeguards such as bias audits, explainability techniques, and transparent provenance tracking of synthetic data should be incorporated into deployment frameworks. Evaluation of generative models is often benchmarked with metrics such as BLEU/ROUGE for text, Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) or Inception Score for images, and perplexity for language models, which provide quantitative grounding for reliability assessments. Conclusion Generative AI is already enriching clinical data pipelines, from radiology suites to drug-discovery labs. The reviewed literature confirms tangible gains in diagnostic accuracy, workflow efficiency, and hypothesis generation, driven chiefly by image-focused GANs, diffusion models, and emerging VLMs. Yet every advantage is tempered by unresolved issues of bias, fidelity, and interpretability. Rare pathologies remain under-represented, demographic disparities can be inadvertently reinforced, and text generators are prone to clinically dangerous hallucinations. Future work must therefore pair technical innovation with stringent validation on external cohorts, transparent reporting of synthetic-data provenance, and user-friendly explanation interfaces. Only through such multidisciplinary vigilance can G-AI move from promising prototypes to trustworthy, equity-focused tools that genuinely advance patient care. Emerging trends such as text-to-3D generation for surgical planning signal new directions for generative AI in clinical practice, while broader applications in education and management remain outside the scope of this review.

The review highlights that G-AI, including GANs, diffusion models, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), is actively used in radiology, dermatology, genetics, and drug discovery. While image-centric applications dominate, narrative (EHR) and molecular design domains are rapidly expanding. Despite demonstrated accuracy gains, challenges persist, such as synthetic data overlooking rare pathologies, multimodal systems hallucinating clinical facts, and the amplification of demographic biases. The article emphasizes the need for robust validation, interpretability techniques like StylEx, and strong governance frameworks to ensure safe and ethical integration of G-AI into routine healthcare practices, ensuring transparent reasoning and addressing bias propagation."

The conference theme draws inspiration from the Shifting Power project which itself was inspired by the thinking of Pratyusha Kalluri of the Radical AI Network . Asking whether AI is good or fair is not the right question, she holds. Instead, we should seek to explore its potential to “shift power” in the direction of learners, who in our context are learners of languages and applied linguistics. The event will be highly relevant for researchers, educators, learners and other languages and applied linguistics practitioners alike. The conference will primarily be conducted in English, and all abstract submissions must be in English. However, we encourage the creative and inclusive use of multiple languages throughout the conference sessions, supported by AI tools for translation to ensure accessibility. Please note that interpretation/translation services will not be provided. All submissions will undergo a double-blind peer review process. Authors will be notified of acceptance in time to register by the registration deadline. Full Programme The conference programme can be downloaded here: Full Programme Scope and Topics This conference will explore how power is being shifted towards, away from, and between learners and educators by AI technologies, and the new dynamic and potential changes this is bringing about in applied linguistics, languages and cultures studies. Potential topics for the papers may include, but are not limited to: AI and its impact on the training and evolving roles of languages and applied linguistics educators and their relationships with learners; AI and its potential to support inclusive and personalised learning in languages and applied linguistics; AI integration into learning, teaching and assessment of languages, cultures and applied linguistics with a focus on ethical issues and sustainability challenges; Core concepts and theoretical frameworks guiding the integration of AI in applied linguistics; Core concepts and theoretical frameworks guiding the integration of AI in the learning and teaching of languages and cultures; Questions around the use of AI in carrying out research in languages, cultures and applied linguistics, and its impact on research processes and outputs. Session Formats Both in-person and virtual attendance will be available. One of the parallel strands will be completely online and open to both online and onsite attendees. The remaining parallel strands will be onsite and open to onsite attendees only. There will be one single online strand with sessions accessible to attendees both online and onsite. The online strand will include the streaming of the keynotes and the expert panel. The online strand will run in parallel with all other strands which will be onsite only (i.e. no online participation ). One presenter from teams who want to present in the online strand must be designated as the online moderator. For sessions with a single presenter, an online moderator will be provided. Onsite presentations – by teams as well as individuals – will all have a moderator. >> Facilitated Discussions (40 minutes) These in person or online sessions should propose a topic or challenge that is relevant to the wider field of AI-enhanced learning and teaching of languages and cultures and (applied) linguistics and provide two to three thought-provoking questions and/or breakout activities in order to guide an interactive conversation with attendees. Proposals can include roles for up to 3 facilitators but should focus on engaging participants rather than developing a panel of presenters. Proposals must describe the topic or challenge and explain the framework for drawing out discussion and involving in-person or online participants in active conversation. Submissions should include the aforementioned questions/discussion prompts and/or breakout activities that the author(s) would like to pose to attendees to spark conversation on the presentation topic. (Proposals for Facilitated Discussions should not exceed 300 words) >> Presentations (20 min) These in-person or online sessions should consist of a maximum of 15 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for Q&A. Presentation proposals should include a full description of what will be presented including a statement highlighting whether the presentation focuses on research or practice . They should also state whether the paper is intended to be presented online or in person . (Proposals for Presentations should not exceed 300 words) Review Criteria Proposals will be assessed on the following criteria: Alignment with a conference topic (see above) Relevant: the proposal has high potential to attract conference attendees by addressing the needs of researchers, educators and other practitioners in (applied) linguistics and the learning and teaching of languages and cultures; its contents can be broadly disseminated and understood Clear: the intended outcomes of the session are easily understood Well Researched: claims are backed by sufficient data, draw on relevant literature and/or multiple perspectives and limitations are acknowledged (presentations of research only) Scope: applicable to a broad range of practitioners at various levels (presentations of practice only) Keynote Speakers >> Prof. Clare Wright – AI Literacy in Higher Education: Developing Nuanced Understandings of Competence, Ethics and Equity Prof Clare Wright | School of Languages, Cultures and Societies | University of Leeds >> Prof. Kate Borthwick – Shifting the dial: the transformational power and challenge of AI in language education Professor Kate Borthwick | University of Southampton >> Dr. Tracie Farrell – Shifting Narratives: efficiency and erasure with GenAI People | Knowledge Media Institute | The Open University Expert Panel There will be a panel of experts chaired by Distinguished Professor Carol Chapelle with contributions aligned with the conference theme by Professor Ron Darvin and Professor Britta Schneider.

This mini-review synthesizes fifteen studies published between 2020 and 2025 that collectively illustrate three dominant trends: data augmentation for imbalanced or privacy-restricted datasets, automation of expert-intensive tasks such as radiology reporting, and generation of new biomedical knowledge ranging from molecular scaffolds to fairness insights. Image-centric work still dominates, with GANs, diffusion models, and Vision-Language Models expanding limited datasets and accelerating diagnosis. Yet narrative (EHR) and molecular design domains are rapidly catching up. Despite demonstrated accuracy gains, recurring challenges persist: synthetic samples may overlook rare pathologies, large multimodal systems can hallucinate clinical facts, and demographic biases can be amplified. Robust validation, interpretability techniques, and governance frameworks therefore, remain essential before G-AI can be safely embedded in routine care. Introduction Healthcare has long grappled with the twin problems of data scarcity and data privacy. Curating large, balanced, and publicly shareable clinical datasets is expensive, logistically complex, and ethically sensitive. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (G-AI)—notably Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders, diffusion models, and large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)—offer a potential remedy by synthesising realistic yet privacy-preserving data. Table 1 collates fifteen representative studies that demonstrate how these models are already reshaping diverse clinical tasks. Table 1 Table 1. Summary of clinical generative AI applications. Medical imaging remains the most prolific test-bed for G-AI. Early work by Han et al. introduced “pathology-aware” GANs that augment computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) datasets and serve as training material for novice radiologists ( 1 ). Subsequent studies refined both fidelity and dimensionality of synthetic images. Aydin et al. re-engineered StyleGANv2 to generate three-dimensional Time-of-Flight MR angiography volumes, boosting multiclass artery segmentation without additional patient scans ( 2 ). Similar philosophies underpin Pawlicka et al.'s colorectal-polyp synthesis, where GAN-generated images alleviate class imbalance and improve endoscopic segmentation accuracy ( 3 ). Ultsch and Lötsch addressed melanoma detection by fine-tuning a latent Stable Diffusion model, proving that diffusion-based methods can rival GANs for dermoscopic realism ( 4 ). The promise of G-AI is not limited to raw pixels. Phipps et al. explored VLMs that translate chest x-ray features into free-text radiology reports, potentially reducing radiologist workload during high-volume shifts ( 5 ). However, their evaluation framework also revealed a tendency to hallucinate clinical findings—a stark reminder that factual grounding remains a critical bottleneck. Complementary efforts by Huang et al. in emergency-department workflows corroborate both the efficiency gains and the evaluation challenges of text-generating models ( 6 ). Beyond imaging, G-AI is venturing into molecular and systemic domains. Zeng et al. leveraged ProteinGAN and hierarchical generative models to design novel proteins and small molecules, accelerating the pre-clinical discovery pipeline ( 7 ). Bordukova et al. harnessed synthetic patient trajectories to construct digital twins that can de-risk costly clinical trials ( 8 ). At the intersection of fairness and analytics, Khosravi et al. generated radiographs that isolate race-linked imaging features, providing a sandbox for bias audits ( 9 ). These successes nonetheless surface persistent limitations. Synthetic data often fails to capture rare anatomical variants or subtle disease phenotypes, risking model over-confidence in out-of-distribution scenarios ( 4 , 10 ). Bias in training corpora can be magnified, as evidenced by demographic skew in pelvic-radiograph synthesis ( 9 ). Large multimodal systems may produce credible but incorrect statements, undermining clinical trust ( 5 , 11 ). Interpretable frameworks such as StylEx, which links StyleGAN latents to human-readable attributes, are therefore gaining traction ( 12 ). Regulatory and ethical considerations further complicate deployment. Frictionless data-sharing enabled by G-AI must still honor patient consent and institutional review protocols. Meanwhile, explainability demands are intensifying; clinicians and regulators alike now expect transparent reasoning pathways before sanctioning AI-assisted decisions. Collectively, the studies surveyed here illuminate both the transformative potential of G-AI and the rigorous safeguards required for its responsible translation to bedside practice. Methodology of literature selection To identify relevant studies, we conducted a targeted search in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus databases covering January 2020–May 2025. Keywords included “generative AI”, “synthetic data”, “clinical practice”, and “healthcare”. From over 65 initial hits, we prioritised peer-reviewed articles that explicitly applied generative AI in clinical contexts. Fifteen representative studies were chosen to illustrate diverse domains (imaging, text, molecular design, and fairness). These were not intended as an exhaustive list, but rather as exemplars highlighting the breadth and key limitations of generative AI in healthcare. Comparative analysis and discussion Table 1 distills fifteen recent studies that deploy generative AI (G-AI) across the clinical data spectrum, with medical imaging emerging as the prime test-bed. More than two-thirds of the entries apply GANs, diffusion models or Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize, augment or interpret radiographs, MRI volumes and dermoscopic, endoscopic or fundus photographs. These image-centric efforts tackle three chronic bottlenecks highlighted in Table 1 : limited data volume, class imbalance and privacy restrictions. For example, Ultsch & Lötsch fine-tune Stable Diffusion to balance melanoma classes, while Aydin et al. extend StyleGANv2 to 3-D angiography volumes, boosting vascular-segmentation accuracy without collecting new scans. Beyond imaging, Table 1 shows G-AI penetrating narrative and molecular domains. Alkhalaf et al. couple a retrieval-augmented Llama-2 with zero-shot prompting to summarise malnutrition risk factors from electronic health records, illustrating how foundation models can tame unstructured clinical text. Zeng et al. harness ProteinGAN to generate bespoke proteins, signalling a shift from data augmentation to de-novo biomedical design. Meanwhile, Pinaya and Bordukova exploit diffusion models to create synthetic chest x-rays and digital-twin trajectories respectively, lowering the cost and ethical burden of large-scale trials. The table also exposes recurring limitations. Synthetic samples often omit rare pathologies, risk distribution shifts (e.g., Pawlicka's colorectal polyps) or encode demographic biases (Khosravi's race-aware radiographs). VLMs hallucinate clinical facts, undermining trust in auto-generated reports. Several authors therefore call for stronger interpretability—Lang's StylEx explicitly pairs StyleGAN with attribute visualisation—and for rigorous external validation before clinical rollout. Collectively, the evidence in Table 1 suggests three near-term pay-offs: (i) privacy-preserving data augmentation that accelerates model development, (ii) automation of expert-intensive tasks such as radiology reporting or phenotype annotation, and (iii) exploratory insight generation that surfaces novel biomarkers or inequities. Realising these benefits, however, hinges on closing interpretability gaps, curbing bias propagation, and establishing governance frameworks that keep pace with rapidly evolving G-AI toolchains. To mitigate these concerns, safeguards such as bias audits, explainability techniques, and transparent provenance tracking of synthetic data should be incorporated into deployment frameworks. Evaluation of generative models is often benchmarked with metrics such as BLEU/ROUGE for text, Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) or Inception Score for images, and perplexity for language models, which provide quantitative grounding for reliability assessments. Conclusion Generative AI is already enriching clinical data pipelines, from radiology suites to drug-discovery labs. The reviewed literature confirms tangible gains in diagnostic accuracy, workflow efficiency, and hypothesis generation, driven chiefly by image-focused GANs, diffusion models, and emerging VLMs. Yet every advantage is tempered by unresolved issues of bias, fidelity, and interpretability. Rare pathologies remain under-represented, demographic disparities can be inadvertently reinforced, and text generators are prone to clinically dangerous hallucinations. Future work must therefore pair technical innovation with stringent validation on external cohorts, transparent reporting of synthetic-data provenance, and user-friendly explanation interfaces. Only through such multidisciplinary vigilance can G-AI move from promising prototypes to trustworthy, equity-focused tools that genuinely advance patient care. Emerging trends such as text-to-3D generation for surgical planning signal new directions for generative AI in clinical practice, while broader applications in education and management remain outside the scope of this review.

Why Providers Are Racing to Adopt AI Medicaid cuts for 2025 total nearly $100 billion in a decade, and ACA premium subsidies run out Dec. 31, 2025. Hospitals and health systems are under pressure to maintain services with lower reimbursement. Next steps matter, and most executives feel that technology is the most short-term fix towards stability. AI assists us in forecasting bottlenecks even before they occur. We have experienced a revenue cycle AI-based revenue cycle management services revenue lift of 81%. Eugene Woods, CEO of Advocate Health, speaking at Modern Healthcare's Leadership Summit on September 25th, 2025. Below are the key reasons why providers invest in AI today: 1. Quicker revenue cycle: AI medical billing systems lower denied claims and speed up approvals using records that are scanned in seconds. 2. Lower administrative costs: Automated clinical documentation and scheduling free up staff to work on patient care rather than bedside. 3. Improved patient results: Predictive analytics allow healthcare to distinguish high-risk patients and treat them before expensive rehospitalizations happen. Letâs break it down. Revenue Cycle Gains: Real Numbers, Real Benefits Revenue cycle powered by AI is no longer in a pilot phase. According to a 2025 survey of hospitals: 81% revenue growth in the AI implementation's first year 73% achieved cost savings from decreased manual work 50% faster claims resolution time Table shows representative ROI information of three typical systems. Table: Representative ROI information of three typical systems Health System Revenue Lift Cost Savings Claims Processing Time Advocate Health +81% $24 million 50% faster Mayo Clinic +68% $18 million 45% faster Westchester MCN +75% $21 million 60% faster The companies that use AI in their denial management offerings have fewer appeals and improved cash flow. Several of their next steps are to scale pilot programs enterprise wide. Turning Data into Decisions Artificial intelligence is good at going through large datasets. That enables clinical and financial executives to use AI to spot waste. Some of the typical AI applications are: Scanning electronic health records to flag missing codes of medical code services Scheduling of patients to enhance utilization rates as well as no-show rates Condensation of clinical notes to improve time spent by physicians with patients Risk stratification to avert costly rehospitalizations We verify eligibility for Medicaid prior to treating ER patients who are uninsured. Our health system employed AI-based outreach to enroll 5,000 patients in a quarter. Dr. David Lubarsky, Westchester Medical Center Health Network. This approach emphasizes healthcare revenue cycle management services that include AI. To understand how we help hospitals automate revenue, check our Success Stories . Strengthening Partnerships for Value-Based Care Value-based partnerships and AI implementation are two peas in a pod. Payors will have to manage two-sided risk as reimbursement shifts from volume to outcome. AI tools enable: Real-time monitoring of community health Automatic identification of care gaps Patient-centered plan of cares powered by predictive models Navvis, a value-based planning firm that helps hospitals plan for value-based reimbursement, claims that its clients have 3-6% cost reductions annually per patient. One such provider decreased its readmissions by 20% and annually saved $4 million. Such numbers demonstrate the financial potential of early AI adoption on a value-based basis. For example: Sutter Health collaborated with Epic Systems and GE HealthCare to implement AI to support clinical and administrative work. Result: better patient throughput and 15% reduced staffing overtime expenditure. Overcoming Hurdles to AI Implementation Although benefits are evident, obstacles exist. Shared problems are: Integration of legacy system data Change management and staff training Complying with privacy laws This is how industry-leading systems handle such variables: 1. Phased Implementation: Begin from revenue cycle automation or outpatient scheduling as quick-impact initiatives. 2. Cross-Functional Teams: Recruit IT, clinical informatics, and billing experts to lead development. 3. Relationships With Vendors: Utilize AI medical billing vendors which have turn-key systems as well as ongoing support. Human Medical Billing often accompanies providers on pilots of medical credentialing services and medical accounts receivable services so that technology can be easily adopted. Learn how our approach works on our How Our Services Works webpage. Humanizing AI in Healthcare Patients fear that AI will result in less human contact. Actually, AI has the potential to bring back human touch by decreasing staff burnout. Physicians have less time to spend on administrative work and more time to listen. By blending medical billing services expertise with clever technology, providers make space for empathy. At Human Medical Billing, we combine AI medical billing expertise with customized support.

Hospitals and health systems are under pressure to maintain services with lower reimbursement. Next steps matter, and most executives feel that technology is the most short-term fix towards stability. AI assists us in forecasting bottlenecks even before they occur. We have experienced a revenue cycle AI-based revenue cycle management services revenue lift of 81%. Eugene Woods, CEO of Advocate Health, speaking at Modern Healthcare's Leadership Summit on September 25th, 2025. Below are the key reasons why providers invest in AI today: 1. Quicker revenue cycle: AI medical billing systems lower denied claims and speed up approvals using records that are scanned in seconds. 2. Lower administrative costs: Automated clinical documentation and scheduling free up staff to work on patient care rather than bedside. 3. Improved patient results: Predictive analytics allow healthcare to distinguish high-risk patients and treat them before expensive rehospitalizations happen. Let’s break it down. Revenue Cycle Gains: Real Numbers, Real Benefits Revenue cycle powered by AI is no longer in a pilot phase. According to a 2025 survey of hospitals: 81% revenue growth in the AI implementation's first year 73% achieved cost savings from decreased manual work 50% faster claims resolution time Table shows representative ROI information of three typical systems. Table: Representative ROI information of three typical systems Health System Revenue Lift Cost Savings Claims Processing Time Advocate Health +81% $24 million 50% faster Mayo Clinic +68% $18 million 45% faster Westchester MCN +75% $21 million 60% faster The companies that use AI in their denial management offerings have fewer appeals and improved cash flow. Several of their next steps are to scale pilot programs enterprise wide. Turning Data into Decisions Artificial intelligence is good at going through large datasets. That enables clinical and financial executives to use AI to spot waste. Some of the typical AI applications are: Scanning electronic health records to flag missing codes of medical code services Scheduling of patients to enhance utilization rates as well as no-show rates Condensation of clinical notes to improve time spent by physicians with patients Risk stratification to avert costly rehospitalizations We verify eligibility for Medicaid prior to treating ER patients who are uninsured. Our health system employed AI-based outreach to enroll 5,000 patients in a quarter. Dr. David Lubarsky, Westchester Medical Center Health Network. This approach emphasizes healthcare revenue cycle management services that include AI. To understand how we help hospitals automate revenue, check our Success Stories . Strengthening Partnerships for Value-Based Care Value-based partnerships and AI implementation are two peas in a pod. Payors will have to manage two-sided risk as reimbursement shifts from volume to outcome. AI tools enable: Real-time monitoring of community health Automatic identification of care gaps Patient-centered plan of cares powered by predictive models Navvis, a value-based planning firm that helps hospitals plan for value-based reimbursement, claims that its clients have 3-6% cost reductions annually per patient. One such provider decreased its readmissions by 20% and annually saved $4 million. Such numbers demonstrate the financial potential of early AI adoption on a value-based basis. For example: Sutter Health collaborated with Epic Systems and GE HealthCare to implement AI to support clinical and administrative work. Result: better patient throughput and 15% reduced staffing overtime expenditure. Overcoming Hurdles to AI Implementation Although benefits are evident, obstacles exist. Shared problems are: Integration of legacy system data Change management and staff training Complying with privacy laws This is how industry-leading systems handle such variables: 1. Phased Implementation: Begin from revenue cycle automation or outpatient scheduling as quick-impact initiatives. 2. Cross-Functional Teams: Recruit IT, clinical informatics, and billing experts to lead development. 3.

Hospitals and health systems are under pressure to maintain services with lower reimbursement. Next steps matter, and most executives feel that technology is the most short-term fix towards stability. AI assists us in forecasting bottlenecks even before they occur. We have experienced a revenue cycle AI-based revenue cycle management services revenue lift of 81%. Eugene Woods, CEO of Advocate Health, speaking at Modern Healthcare's Leadership Summit on September 25th, 2025. Below are the key reasons why providers invest in AI today: 1. Quicker revenue cycle: AI medical billing systems lower denied claims and speed up approvals using records that are scanned in seconds. 2. Lower administrative costs: Automated clinical documentation and scheduling free up staff to work on patient care rather than bedside. 3. Improved patient results: Predictive analytics allow healthcare to distinguish high-risk patients and treat them before expensive rehospitalizations happen. Let’s break it down. Revenue Cycle Gains: Real Numbers, Real Benefits Revenue cycle powered by AI is no longer in a pilot phase. According to a 2025 survey of hospitals: 81% revenue growth in the AI implementation's first year 73% achieved cost savings from decreased manual work 50% faster claims resolution time Table shows representative ROI information of three typical systems. Table: Representative ROI information of three typical systems Health System Revenue Lift Cost Savings Claims Processing Time Advocate Health +81% $24 million 50% faster Mayo Clinic +68% $18 million 45% faster Westchester MCN +75% $21 million 60% faster The companies that use AI in their denial management offerings have fewer appeals and improved cash flow. Several of their next steps are to scale pilot programs enterprise wide. Turning Data into Decisions Artificial intelligence is good at going through large datasets. That enables clinical and financial executives to use AI to spot waste. Some of the typical AI applications are: Scanning electronic health records to flag missing codes of medical code services Scheduling of patients to enhance utilization rates as well as no-show rates Condensation of clinical notes to improve time spent by physicians with patients Risk stratification to avert costly rehospitalizations We verify eligibility for Medicaid prior to treating ER patients who are uninsured. Our health system employed AI-based outreach to enroll 5,000 patients in a quarter. Dr. David Lubarsky, Westchester Medical Center Health Network. This approach emphasizes healthcare revenue cycle management services that include AI. To understand how we help hospitals automate revenue, check our Success Stories . Strengthening Partnerships for Value-Based Care Value-based partnerships and AI implementation are two peas in a pod. Payors will have to manage two-sided risk as reimbursement shifts from volume to outcome. AI tools enable: Real-time monitoring of community health Automatic identification of care gaps Patient-centered plan of cares powered by predictive models Navvis, a value-based planning firm that helps hospitals plan for value-based reimbursement, claims that its clients have 3-6% cost reductions annually per patient. One such provider decreased its readmissions by 20% and annually saved $4 million. Such numbers demonstrate the financial potential of early AI adoption on a value-based basis. For example: Sutter Health collaborated with Epic Systems and GE HealthCare to implement AI to support clinical and administrative work. Result: better patient throughput and 15% reduced staffing overtime expenditure. Overcoming Hurdles to AI Implementation Although benefits are evident, obstacles exist. Shared problems are: Integration of legacy system data Change management and staff training Complying with privacy laws This is how industry-leading systems handle such variables: 1. Phased Implementation: Begin from revenue cycle automation or outpatient scheduling as quick-impact initiatives. 2. Cross-Functional Teams: Recruit IT, clinical informatics, and billing experts to lead development. 3.

This mini-review synthesizes fifteen studies published between 2020 and 2025 that collectively illustrate three dominant trends: data augmentation for imbalanced or privacy-restricted datasets, automation of expert-intensive tasks such as radiology reporting, and generation of new biomedical knowledge ranging from molecular scaffolds to fairness insights. Image-centric work still dominates, with GANs, diffusion models, and Vision-Language Models expanding limited datasets and accelerating diagnosis. Yet narrative (EHR) and molecular design domains are rapidly catching up. Despite demonstrated accuracy gains, recurring challenges persist: synthetic samples may overlook rare pathologies, large multimodal systems can hallucinate clinical facts, and demographic biases can be amplified. Robust validation, interpretability techniques, and governance frameworks therefore, remain essential before G-AI can be safely embedded in routine care. Introduction Healthcare has long grappled with the twin problems of data scarcity and data privacy. Curating large, balanced, and publicly shareable clinical datasets is expensive, logistically complex, and ethically sensitive. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (G-AI)—notably Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders, diffusion models, and large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)—offer a potential remedy by synthesising realistic yet privacy-preserving data. Table 1 collates fifteen representative studies that demonstrate how these models are already reshaping diverse clinical tasks. Table 1 Table 1. Summary of clinical generative AI applications. Medical imaging remains the most prolific test-bed for G-AI. Early work by Han et al. introduced “pathology-aware” GANs that augment computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) datasets and serve as training material for novice radiologists ( 1 ). Subsequent studies refined both fidelity and dimensionality of synthetic images. Aydin et al. re-engineered StyleGANv2 to generate three-dimensional Time-of-Flight MR angiography volumes, boosting multiclass artery segmentation without additional patient scans ( 2 ). Similar philosophies underpin Pawlicka et al.\\'s colorectal-polyp synthesis, where GAN-generated images alleviate class imbalance and improve endoscopic segmentation accuracy ( 3 ). Ultsch and Lötsch addressed melanoma detection by fine-tuning a latent Stable Diffusion model, proving that diffusion-based methods can rival GANs for dermoscopic realism ( 4 ). The promise of G-AI is not limited to raw pixels. Phipps et al. explored VLMs that translate chest x-ray features into free-text radiology reports, potentially reducing radiologist workload during high-volume shifts ( 5 ). However, their evaluation framework also revealed a tendency to hallucinate clinical findings—a stark reminder that factual grounding remains a critical bottleneck. Complementary efforts by Huang et al. in emergency-department workflows corroborate both the efficiency gains and the evaluation challenges of text-generating models ( 6 ). Beyond imaging, G-AI is venturing into molecular and systemic domains. Zeng et al. leveraged ProteinGAN and hierarchical generative models to design novel proteins and small molecules, accelerating the pre-clinical discovery pipeline ( 7 ). Bordukova et al. harnessed synthetic patient trajectories to construct digital twins that can de-risk costly clinical trials ( 8 ). At the intersection of fairness and analytics, Khosravi et al. generated radiographs that isolate race-linked imaging features, providing a sandbox for bias audits ( 9 ). These successes nonetheless surface persistent limitations. Synthetic data often fails to capture rare anatomical variants or subtle disease phenotypes, risking model over-confidence in out-of-distribution scenarios ( 4 , 10 ). Bias in training corpora can be magnified, as evidenced by demographic skew in pelvic-radiograph synthesis ( 9 ). Large multimodal systems may produce credible but incorrect statements, undermining clinical trust ( 5 , 11 ). Interpretable frameworks such as StylEx, which links StyleGAN latents to human-readable attributes, are therefore gaining traction ( 12 ). Regulatory and ethical considerations further complicate deployment. Frictionless data-sharing enabled by G-AI must still honor patient consent and institutional review protocols. Meanwhile, explainability demands are intensifying; clinicians and regulators alike now expect transparent reasoning pathways before sanctioning AI-assisted decisions. Collectively, the studies surveyed here illuminate both the transformative potential of G-AI and the rigorous safeguards required for its responsible translation to bedside practice. Methodology of literature selection To identify relevant studies, we conducted a targeted search in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus databases covering January 2020–May 2025. Keywords included “generative AI”, “synthetic data”, “clinical practice”, and “healthcare”. From over 65 initial hits, we prioritised peer-reviewed articles that explicitly applied generative AI in clinical contexts. Fifteen representative studies were chosen to illustrate diverse domains (imaging, text, molecular design, and fairness). These were not intended as an exhaustive list, but rather as exemplars highlighting the breadth and key limitations of generative AI in healthcare. Comparative analysis and discussion Table 1 distills fifteen recent studies that deploy generative AI (G-AI) across the clinical data spectrum, with medical imaging emerging as the prime test-bed. More than two-thirds of the entries apply GANs, diffusion models or Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize, augment or interpret radiographs, MRI volumes and dermoscopic, endoscopic or fundus photographs. These image-centric efforts tackle three chronic bottlenecks highlighted in Table 1 : limited data volume, class imbalance and privacy restrictions. For example, Ultsch & Lötsch fine-tune Stable Diffusion to balance melanoma classes, while Aydin et al. extend StyleGANv2 to 3-D angiography volumes, boosting vascular-segmentation accuracy without collecting new scans. Beyond imaging, Table 1 shows G-AI penetrating narrative and molecular domains. Alkhalaf et al. couple a retrieval-augmented Llama-2 with zero-shot prompting to summarise malnutrition risk factors from electronic health records, illustrating how foundation models can tame unstructured clinical text. Zeng et al. harness ProteinGAN to generate bespoke proteins, signalling a shift from data augmentation to de-novo biomedical design. Meanwhile, Pinaya and Bordukova exploit diffusion models to create synthetic chest x-rays and digital-twin trajectories respectively, lowering the cost and ethical burden of large-scale trials. The table also exposes recurring limitations. Synthetic samples often omit rare pathologies, risk distribution shifts (e.g., Pawlicka\\'s colorectal polyps) or encode demographic biases (Khosravi\\'s race-aware radiographs). VLMs hallucinate clinical facts, undermining trust in auto-generated reports. Several authors therefore call for stronger interpretability—Lang\\'s StylEx explicitly pairs StyleGAN with attribute visualisation—and for rigorous external validation before clinical rollout. Collectively, the evidence in Table 1 suggests three near-term pay-offs: (i) privacy-preserving data augmentation that accelerates model development, (ii) automation of expert-intensive tasks such as radiology reporting or phenotype annotation, and (iii) exploratory insight generation that surfaces novel biomarkers or inequities. Realising these benefits, however, hinges on closing interpretability gaps, curbing bias propagation, and establishing governance frameworks that keep pace with rapidly evolving G-AI toolchains. To mitigate these concerns, safeguards such as bias audits, explainability techniques, and transparent provenance tracking of synthetic data should be incorporated into deployment frameworks. Evaluation of generative models is often benchmarked with metrics such as BLEU/ROUGE for text, Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) or Inception Score for images, and perplexity for language models, which provide quantitative grounding for reliability assessments. Conclusion Generative AI is already enriching clinical data pipelines, from radiology suites to drug-discovery labs. The reviewed literature confirms tangible gains in diagnostic accuracy, workflow efficiency, and hypothesis generation, driven chiefly by image-focused GANs, diffusion models, and emerging VLMs. Yet every advantage is tempered by unresolved issues of bias, fidelity, and interpretability. Rare pathologies remain under-represented, demographic disparities can be inadvertently reinforced, and text generators are prone to clinically dangerous hallucinations. Future work must therefore pair technical innovation with stringent validation on external cohorts, transparent reporting of synthetic-data provenance, and user-friendly explanation interfaces. Only through such multidisciplinary vigilance can G-AI move from promising prototypes to trustworthy, equity-focused tools that genuinely advance patient care. Emerging trends such as text-to-3D generation for surgical planning signal new directions for generative AI in clinical practice, while broader applications in education and management remain outside the scope of this review.

The conference theme draws inspiration from the Shifting Power project which itself was inspired by the thinking of Pratyusha Kalluri of the Radical AI Network . Asking whether AI is good or fair is not the right question, she holds. Instead, we should seek to explore its potential to “shift power” in the direction of learners, who in our context are learners of languages and applied linguistics. The event will be highly relevant for researchers, educators, learners and other languages and applied linguistics practitioners alike. The conference will primarily be conducted in English, and all abstract submissions must be in English. However, we encourage the creative and inclusive use of multiple languages throughout the conference sessions, supported by AI tools for translation to ensure accessibility. Please note that interpretation/translation services will not be provided. All submissions will undergo a double-blind peer review process. Authors will be notified of acceptance in time to register by the registration deadline. Full Programme The conference programme can be downloaded here: Full Programme Scope and Topics This conference will explore how power is being shifted towards, away from, and between learners and educators by AI technologies, and the new dynamic and potential changes this is bringing about in applied linguistics, languages and cultures studies. Potential topics for the papers may include, but are not limited to: AI and its impact on the training and evolving roles of languages and applied linguistics educators and their relationships with learners; AI and its potential to support inclusive and personalised learning in languages and applied linguistics; AI integration into learning, teaching and assessment of languages, cultures and applied linguistics with a focus on ethical issues and sustainability challenges; Core concepts and theoretical frameworks guiding the integration of AI in applied linguistics; Core concepts and theoretical frameworks guiding the integration of AI in the learning and teaching of languages and cultures; Questions around the use of AI in carrying out research in languages, cultures and applied linguistics, and its impact on research processes and outputs. Session Formats Both in-person and virtual attendance will be available. One of the parallel strands will be completely online and open to both online and onsite attendees. The remaining parallel strands will be onsite and open to onsite attendees only. There will be one single online strand with sessions accessible to attendees both online and onsite. The online strand will include the streaming of the keynotes and the expert panel. The online strand will run in parallel with all other strands which will be onsite only (i.e. no online participation ). One presenter from teams who want to present in the online strand must be designated as the online moderator. For sessions with a single presenter, an online moderator will be provided. Onsite presentations – by teams as well as individuals – will all have a moderator. >> Facilitated Discussions (40 minutes) These in person or online sessions should propose a topic or challenge that is relevant to the wider field of AI-enhanced learning and teaching of languages and cultures and (applied) linguistics and provide two to three thought-provoking questions and/or breakout activities in order to guide an interactive conversation with attendees. Proposals can include roles for up to 3 facilitators but should focus on engaging participants rather than developing a panel of presenters. Proposals must describe the topic or challenge and explain the framework for drawing out discussion and involving in-person or online participants in active conversation. Submissions should include the aforementioned questions/discussion prompts and/or breakout activities that the author(s) would like to pose to attendees to spark conversation on the presentation topic. (Proposals for Facilitated Discussions should not exceed 300 words) >> Presentations (20 min) These in-person or online sessions should consist of a maximum of 15 minutes for the presentation and 5 minutes for Q&A. Presentation proposals should include a full description of what will be presented including a statement highlighting whether the presentation focuses on research or practice . They should also state whether the paper is intended to be presented online or in person . (Proposals for Presentations should not exceed 300 words) Review Criteria Proposals will be assessed on the following criteria: Alignment with a conference topic (see above) Relevant: the proposal has high potential to attract conference attendees by addressing the needs of researchers, educators and other practitioners in (applied) linguistics and the learning and teaching of languages and cultures; its contents can be broadly disseminated and understood Clear: the intended outcomes of the session are easily understood Well Researched: claims are backed by sufficient data, draw on relevant literature and/or multiple perspectives and limitations are acknowledged (presentations of research only) Scope: applicable to a broad range of practitioners at various levels (presentations of practice only) Keynote Speakers >> Prof. Clare Wright – AI Literacy in Higher Education: Developing Nuanced Understandings of Competence, Ethics and Equity Prof Clare Wright | School of Languages, Cultures and Societies | University of Leeds >> Prof. Kate Borthwick – Shifting the dial: the transformational power and challenge of AI in language education Professor Kate Borthwick | University of Southampton >> Dr. Tracie Farrell – Shifting Narratives: efficiency and erasure with GenAI People | Knowledge Media Institute | The Open University Expert Panel There will be a panel of experts chaired by Distinguished Professor Carol Chapelle with contributions aligned with the conference theme by Professor Ron Darvin and Professor Britta Schneider.

This mini-review synthesizes fifteen studies published between 2020 and 2025 that collectively illustrate three dominant trends: data augmentation for imbalanced or privacy-restricted datasets, automation of expert-intensive tasks such as radiology reporting, and generation of new biomedical knowledge ranging from molecular scaffolds to fairness insights. Image-centric work still dominates, with GANs, diffusion models, and Vision-Language Models expanding limited datasets and accelerating diagnosis. Yet narrative (EHR) and molecular design domains are rapidly catching up. Despite demonstrated accuracy gains, recurring challenges persist: synthetic samples may overlook rare pathologies, large multimodal systems can hallucinate clinical facts, and demographic biases can be amplified. Robust validation, interpretability techniques, and governance frameworks therefore, remain essential before G-AI can be safely embedded in routine care. Introduction Healthcare has long grappled with the twin problems of data scarcity and data privacy. Curating large, balanced, and publicly shareable clinical datasets is expensive, logistically complex, and ethically sensitive. Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (G-AI)—notably Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders, diffusion models, and large Vision-Language Models (VLMs)—offer a potential remedy by synthesising realistic yet privacy-preserving data. Table 1 collates fifteen representative studies that demonstrate how these models are already reshaping diverse clinical tasks. Table 1 Table 1. Summary of clinical generative AI applications. Medical imaging remains the most prolific test-bed for G-AI. Early work by Han et al. introduced “pathology-aware” GANs that augment computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) datasets and serve as training material for novice radiologists ( 1 ). Subsequent studies refined both fidelity and dimensionality of synthetic images. Aydin et al. re-engineered StyleGANv2 to generate three-dimensional Time-of-Flight MR angiography volumes, boosting multiclass artery segmentation without additional patient scans ( 2 ). Similar philosophies underpin Pawlicka et al.\\'s colorectal-polyp synthesis, where GAN-generated images alleviate class imbalance and improve endoscopic segmentation accuracy ( 3 ). Ultsch and Lötsch addressed melanoma detection by fine-tuning a latent Stable Diffusion model, proving that diffusion-based methods can rival GANs for dermoscopic realism ( 4 ). The promise of G-AI is not limited to raw pixels. Phipps et al. explored VLMs that translate chest x-ray features into free-text radiology reports, potentially reducing radiologist workload during high-volume shifts ( 5 ). However, their evaluation framework also revealed a tendency to hallucinate clinical findings—a stark reminder that factual grounding remains a critical bottleneck. Complementary efforts by Huang et al. in emergency-department workflows corroborate both the efficiency gains and the evaluation challenges of text-generating models ( 6 ). Beyond imaging, G-AI is venturing into molecular and systemic domains. Zeng et al. leveraged ProteinGAN and hierarchical generative models to design novel proteins and small molecules, accelerating the pre-clinical discovery pipeline ( 7 ). Bordukova et al. harnessed synthetic patient trajectories to construct digital twins that can de-risk costly clinical trials ( 8 ). At the intersection of fairness and analytics, Khosravi et al. generated radiographs that isolate race-linked imaging features, providing a sandbox for bias audits ( 9 ). These successes nonetheless surface persistent limitations. Synthetic data often fails to capture rare anatomical variants or subtle disease phenotypes, risking model over-confidence in out-of-distribution scenarios ( 4 , 10 ). Bias in training corpora can be magnified, as evidenced by demographic skew in pelvic-radiograph synthesis ( 9 ). Large multimodal systems may produce credible but incorrect statements, undermining clinical trust ( 5 , 11 ). Interpretable frameworks such as StylEx, which links StyleGAN latents to human-readable attributes, are therefore gaining traction ( 12 ). Regulatory and ethical considerations further complicate deployment. Frictionless data-sharing enabled by G-AI must still honor patient consent and institutional review protocols. Meanwhile, explainability demands are intensifying; clinicians and regulators alike now expect transparent reasoning pathways before sanctioning AI-assisted decisions. Collectively, the studies surveyed here illuminate both the transformative potential of G-AI and the rigorous safeguards required for its responsible translation to bedside practice. Methodology of literature selection To identify relevant studies, we conducted a targeted search in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and Scopus databases covering January 2020–May 2025. Keywords included “generative AI”, “synthetic data”, “clinical practice”, and “healthcare”. From over 65 initial hits, we prioritised peer-reviewed articles that explicitly applied generative AI in clinical contexts. Fifteen representative studies were chosen to illustrate diverse domains (imaging, text, molecular design, and fairness). These were not intended as an exhaustive list, but rather as exemplars highlighting the breadth and key limitations of generative AI in healthcare. Comparative analysis and discussion Table 1 distills fifteen recent studies that deploy generative AI (G-AI) across the clinical data spectrum, with medical imaging emerging as the prime test-bed. More than two-thirds of the entries apply GANs, diffusion models or Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to synthesize, augment or interpret radiographs, MRI volumes and dermoscopic, endoscopic or fundus photographs. These image-centric efforts tackle three chronic bottlenecks highlighted in Table 1 : limited data volume, class imbalance and privacy restrictions. For example, Ultsch & Lötsch fine-tune Stable Diffusion to balance melanoma classes, while Aydin et al. extend StyleGANv2 to 3-D angiography volumes, boosting vascular-segmentation accuracy without collecting new scans. Beyond imaging, Table 1 shows G-AI penetrating narrative and molecular domains. Alkhalaf et al. couple a retrieval-augmented Llama-2 with zero-shot prompting to summarise malnutrition risk factors from electronic health records, illustrating how foundation models can tame unstructured clinical text. Zeng et al. harness ProteinGAN to generate bespoke proteins, signalling a shift from data augmentation to de-novo biomedical design. Meanwhile, Pinaya and Bordukova exploit diffusion models to create synthetic chest x-rays and digital-twin trajectories respectively, lowering the cost and ethical burden of large-scale trials. The table also exposes recurring limitations. Synthetic samples often omit rare pathologies, risk distribution shifts (e.g., Pawlicka\\'s colorectal polyps) or encode demographic biases (Khosravi\\'s race-aware radiographs). VLMs hallucinate clinical facts, undermining trust in auto-generated reports. Several authors therefore call for stronger interpretability—Lang\\'s StylEx explicitly pairs StyleGAN with attribute visualisation—and for rigorous external validation before clinical rollout. Collectively, the evidence in Table 1 suggests three near-term pay-offs: (i) privacy-preserving data augmentation that accelerates model development, (ii) automation of expert-intensive tasks such as radiology reporting or phenotype annotation, and (iii) exploratory insight generation that surfaces novel biomarkers or inequities. Realising these benefits, however, hinges on closing interpretability gaps, curbing bias propagation, and establishing governance frameworks that keep pace with rapidly evolving G-AI toolchains. To mitigate these concerns, safeguards such as bias audits, explainability techniques, and transparent provenance tracking of synthetic data should be incorporated into deployment frameworks. Evaluation of generative models is often benchmarked with metrics such as BLEU/ROUGE for text, Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) or Inception Score for images, and perplexity for language models, which provide quantitative grounding for reliability assessments. Conclusion Generative AI is already enriching clinical data pipelines, from radiology suites to drug-discovery labs. The reviewed literature confirms tangible gains in diagnostic accuracy, workflow efficiency, and hypothesis generation, driven chiefly by image-focused GANs, diffusion models, and emerging VLMs. Yet every advantage is tempered by unresolved issues of bias, fidelity, and interpretability. Rare pathologies remain under-represented, demographic disparities can be inadvertently reinforced, and text generators are prone to clinically dangerous hallucinations. Future work must therefore pair technical innovation with stringent validation on external cohorts, transparent reporting of synthetic-data provenance, and user-friendly explanation interfaces. Only through such multidisciplinary vigilance can G-AI move from promising prototypes to trustworthy, equity-focused tools that genuinely advance patient care. Emerging trends such as text-to-3D generation for surgical planning signal new directions for generative AI in clinical practice, while broader applications in education and management remain outside the scope of this review.
